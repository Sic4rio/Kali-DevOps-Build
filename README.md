# Kali-DevOps-Build
Building your standard Kali environment using Terraform &amp; Ansible

# Introduction

The purpose of this guide is to share with you my automated Kali build. Anyone who has used Kali for some time has no doubt broken it multiple times and been faced with the prospect of having to rebuild a machine that you have spent countless hours perfecting on for it to fail at the wrong time. Many people utilise Virtual Machines and snapshots to be able to have a **known good** build that they can simply clone.
